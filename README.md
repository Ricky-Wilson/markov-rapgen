This is where I put code to demonstrate python knowledge to any potential employers.

database_initializer.py is a script that uses markovify to build markov text associates between two source texts. it then writes a pickle data to file.
phrase_generator.py retrieves the pickle data and prints 5x markov sentences from that pickle data

in this version, the text sources are a isaac asimov physics text and a anton lavey text
