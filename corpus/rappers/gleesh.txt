Cause I damn sure snatched that thang up
Feel me, Gleesh

And my producer didn’t make this here beat
But Ima make you think that he made it for me
And we don’t need help with yo producers
Cause yo Manage Mitch team is filled with losers pffft
And I done cranked the G like fast with the loose do
You fire that shit up and it smell like the poop do
You break it down 05 just like it’s Fubu
You sure fooled me, I hope it ain’t fool you
And niggas round here try to be like they bullet proof
A fool proof plan hit they ass like them bullets do

Monster say Flacka my shit say Flacka
No Waka Flocka my shit say Flacka
My shit say tote em my shit say hold em
That’s why I stand out there on Otis
Packer witya figured yo shit kush say roll it
Only ask for one thing just give me one moment
gone

Damn! Where the fuck this nigga just go?
Aye boogie? Boogie! Boogie? Damn, this nigga really left
But look, hey it’s Rpm. Bitch! It’s Takeover Entertainment and all that shit
You know what it is
Gone
